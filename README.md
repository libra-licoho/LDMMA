# LDMMA
python and Matlab code for experiments of LDMMA

LDMMA is an algorithm for hyperparameter optimization problems proposed in the article "Lower-level Duality Based Reformulation and Majorization Minimization Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization"

The Python code employs the cvxpy package with open-source solvers ECOS and SCS to solve hyperparameter optimization problems. The code also utilizes several other algorithms for comparison, including VF-iDCA, grid search, random search, Implicit Differentiation and TPE.
The Matlab code uses the MOSEK solver to address hyperparameter optimization problems with the algorithm LDMMA. 

To execute the code, it is necessary to add the appropriate pathways within the code before running it.
